python script to control my volumio setup via telegram bot

you need to create a IPs.py file in the root directory containing IPs and usernames in the format:

kodi_IP='root@192.168.0.XX'

plug_kodi_IP='192.168.0.XX'

etc

you need to create a pibot_token.py file in root directory containing your telegram bot API token in the format:

token = '879784535:AAFbXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

same with pimusicbot_token.py

in addition, you need a IDList.py with your allowed telegram IDs
